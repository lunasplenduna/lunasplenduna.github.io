				<p>After recognizing the fact that while teens need internships and jobs now more than ever, they struggle immensely with the process because often times than not, they have no guidance. As a result, teens and college students find themselves unemployed with little to no workforce experience and nothing productive to put on their college applications. As a solution to this problem, we went about creating a website that would not only match young adults with jobs and internships directly from credible companies around their location based on their interests but also provide them with email templates for networking with company leaders and guidance through resume writing and job interviews. Like Linkedin, companies would be able to post jobs offers and available internships directly to the website on their company’s page. Additionally, much like Glassdoor, the members of the website would be able to anonymously rate their experiences at the companies they’ve worked at/interned for and post suggestions on how to make the best out working at said company. Essentially, Werk is a fresh new approach to a decade old problem facing our young people because our company acknowledges that in order to create a better future we must first make a conscious choice to equip our future leaders with the skills and guidance they need to succeed.</p>
